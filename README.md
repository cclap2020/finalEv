## FrontEnd
  1. Contains 3 Pages <br/>
    - Register <br/>
    - Sign In <br/>
    - PrivatePage <br/>
  2. ALL CRUD operations are available for user <br/>
  3. Connected Frontend to Backend Server<br/>
  
  Missing Functionalities: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**AdminPage**
 
 
 ## BackEnd
 
 1. Connect Localhost server to Firestore Database <br/>
 2. Receive request from front end to perform actual CRUD operation. <br/>
 
 <p> Firestore database is mainly used as pure database in my project, I handle authentication and authorization in my backend, 
 rather than using the Auth functionality provided by Firebase </p> <br/>
 

   Missing Functionalities: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Admin Role** (Only small part of it was created)
